# Install Julia
Julia has its own installer called `juliaup`, all you have to do is follow the instructions [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

# Run Julia
Like Python, Julia can be used both in an interactive way and to execute a script. We will start from Julia `REPL` (Read Execute Print Loop).

## Julia REPL
Julia REPL is way more reach respect to Python REPL, in particular some of the key features are:
1. Direct access to the `shell`, you can execute any shell command from within Julia REPL, all you have to do is type `;` and you will enter the `shell` mode.
2. Direct access to its package manager `Pkg`, we will say more about it later.
3. Tab completion, which means that it recognizes the word while you are writing it and it suggests how to complete it.
4. Special characters support, like greek letters ψ, subscripts ψₒ, but also emoticons 😸(if you are wondering whether it is possible to use a cat as a variable, yes it is. I love to use 🤦 in error messages).
