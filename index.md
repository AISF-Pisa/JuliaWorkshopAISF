Julia is a relatively new programming language designed for scientific computation. It offers an interface as easy to use as Python's but with performance comparable to static programming languages like C and Fortran.

Below is the scheduled program for the workshop conducted during the academic year 2024/2025. It may be subject to changes, so we invite you to stay updated by visiting this page.

The workshop consists of 4 lessons, each lasting 2 hours. The first two lessons will provide an introduction to Julia and its syntax. The third lesson will cover some utility packages in Julia. The final lesson will involve a more advanced application of the concepts learned in the previous lessons, specifically building a module to perform Monte Carlo simulations.

## Lesson 0: Estimated Date 8/Apr/2025
1. A brief [Introduction](Lesson0/Introduction.pdf) to Julia, explaining what it is and why you should learn it.
2. A guide to the [Installation and Package Manager](Lesson0/Installation.html).
3. An explanation of [Types and Multiple Dispatch](Lesson0/Types_and_MultipleDispatch.html) in Julia.

## Lesson 1: Estimated Date 15/Apr/2025
1. Learn about the different [Scopes](Lesson1/Scopes.html) in Julia.
2. Understand how to [Control the Flow](Lesson1/Control_Flow.jl) of execution.
3. Explore Julia's [Macros](Lesson1/macros.jl) and advanced usage of [Functions](Lesson1/more_functions.jl).
4. Learn about Julia's Garbage Collector.

## Lesson 2: Estimated Date 29/Apr/2025
This lesson focuses on utility packages, including:
1. **BenchmarkTools**: A library with utility macros for benchmarking operations and functions.
2. **LoggingExtras**: A library for more fine-grained control over logging output.
3. **Plots**: A library for creating visualizations.
4. **HDF5**: A library for interfacing with HDF5 files, commonly used to store large datasets.

## Lesson 3: Estimated Date 6/May/2025
Develop your own module to perform a Monte Carlo simulation.
