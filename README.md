## Presentation
This repository contains the slides and code that will be used during the Julia Workshop at the University of Pisa for the `AISF` (Associazione Italiana Studenti di Fisica).

As of now, the slides are only in Italian, but they will probably be rewritten in English in the future to make them accessible to a wider audience.

The `Pluto` notebooks can be found in `HTML` format [here](https://vinceneede.github.io/JuliaWorkshopAISF/)
